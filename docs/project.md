Project Challenge: Garage Storage Marketplace – Airbnb-style platform for renting out unused garage space

📌 Why i choose this challenge

I decided to take on the Garage Storage Marketplace challenge because it combines multiple interesting aspects of modern application development:

1. Real-World Problem Solving
    Many people have unused garage space while others struggle with finding affordable, nearby storage.
    This challenge tackles a practical problem with a solution similar to Airbnb’s proven model.

2. Complex System Design
    The project requires handling two sides of a marketplace: hosts (garage owners) and renters (users needing storage).
    It pushes me to think about authentication, payments, booking systems, reviews, maps, and availability management.

3. Scalability & Tech Stack Practice
    I’ll get to apply my skills in mobile + web development, integrating APIs (maps, payments, geolocation).

4. UI/UX Challenge
    Designing a seamless user experience for browsing, Searching, booking, and managing listings is both fun and challenging.

5. Future Potential
    This project is portfolio-worthy because it demonstrates building a full two-sided marketplace with real-world use cases, not just a CRUD app.

🛠️ Stack / Tools Used

1. React Native (Expo) – For the mobile app.
2. Zustand – For state management.

🚀 How I Would Take the Project to Completion

1. Core Features (MVP for React Native app)
    User Authentication – Sign up, login, social login (Google/Apple).
    User Profiles – Two modes:
    Host: Can list garage/storage space.
    Renter: Can search and book available spaces.
    Space Listings – Upload photos, add pricing, availability, location.
    Search & Filters – Search garages by city, radius, price, size, amenities.
    Booking Flow – Request → Approval/Instant booking → Payment.
    Payments – Integration with Stripe/Paystack for secure transactions.
    Messaging System – In-app chat between host & renter.
    Reviews & Ratings – After booking completion.

2. Scaling the App
    Offline Mode – Cache recent searches & bookings with AsyncStorage.
    Push Notifications – Booking confirmation, reminders, and updates via Firebase.
    Performance Optimizations – Lazy load images.
    Pagination for listings.
    React Native Reanimated for smooth UX.

3. Architecture Choices
    State Management – Zustand for global state.
    API Communication – Axios for data fetching & caching.
    Navigation – Expo Router for stack & tab flows.
    Modular Structure – Separate features:
    auth/ (login, signup)
    Wishlist/ ( view garages)
    booking/ (checkout, history)
    profile/ (user info, settings)
    message/ (Send message to garage owners)
    explore/ (View all garage listing)
    Scalability – Code splitting, TypeScript strict typing, and clean folder structure.

4. Future Enhancements
    Map Integration – Show available garages on a map (Google Maps API).
    Subscriptions for Hosts – Premium plans for hosts to list more garages.
    AI Recommendations – Personalized search results (later).
    Cross-Platform Expansion – Publish to iOS & Android with Expo EAS Build.
